 * Interest-list email capture → private Google Sheet ("hidden database")
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Every "Notify me" signup is POSTed to a Google Apps Script Web App
 * that appends the email + a timestamp to a Google Sheet only you can
 * see. That Sheet IS the hidden database. One-time setup:
 *
 *   1. Create a Google Sheet (this is your database). Optional: add a
 *      header row  ->  Timestamp | Email
 *   2. In that Sheet: Extensions → Apps Script. Delete the placeholder
 *      code and paste the contents of `apps-script/Code.gs` (in this
 *      repo). Save.
 *   3. Deploy → New deployment → gear icon → "Web app".
 *        • Execute as: Me
 *        • Who has access: Anyone
 *      Click Deploy, authorize, and copy the "Web app" URL — it looks
 *      like https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfyc.../exec
 *   4. Paste that URL into SIGNUP_ENDPOINT below.
 *
 * Until it's set, the bar runs in demo mode (shows success, stores
 * nothing). No secrets live in this file — the endpoint URL is safe to
 * ship; only you can read the Sheet it writes to.
